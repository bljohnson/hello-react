#Simple React App

* This is a simple React app built under the guidance of the Udemy course, "The Complete React Web App Developer Course." The purpose of this is to gain basic understanding of how a React app is structured, including components (purpose, different types, nested components, how to get them to communicate, etc.), JSX basics,  user events and callbacks, and props versus state.
